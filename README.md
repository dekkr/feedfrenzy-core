# feedfrenzy-core
Core of the Feedfrenzy application.

Feedfrenzy scrapes websites and turns the content into syndication feeds (RSS), for consumption in feed readers, widgets etcetera. Feedfrenzy consists of a core part (this) and a backend (feedfrenzy-backend).

**Not yet implemented.**

##Functionality
* Scheduler  
* Persistence
* Feed syndication
* Admin front-end
* Website

The last 3 might eventually be split-off into a separate project, feedfrenzy-frontend.
